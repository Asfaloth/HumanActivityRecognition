# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - Programming Assignment

The script `run_analyis.R` generates the two dataframes `data` and `data2` in the workspace of R (see the `README.md` for details) (`data2` also is stored in the `average_data.txt` in this repo). This code book contains information about 

1. The experiment the data come from, 
2. The way the original data are processed by `run_analysis.R` to obtain the dataframes `data` and `data2`
3. The variables and the data in `data` and `data2`,

### 1. The Experiment and the original data

Here are the data for the project:

Here are the most important informations about the experiment from the above website resp. the `UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt` and the `UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt` (contained in the above archive):

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.   
> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

> For each record it is provided:
> - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
> - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
> - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
> - Its activity label. 
> - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.   
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).   
> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).   
> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

### 2. Processing of the data

The data described in 1. are processed by the script `run_analysis.R` contained in this repo.
For details about the implementation see the `run_analysis.R` script itself which contains many comments.

#### Which files are used
Of the data provided in the above zip archive the following files are used:
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt`: subject labels of the test subjects
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt`: activity labels of the test subjects
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt`: records of the test subjects
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt`: subject labels of the train subjects
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt`: activity labels of the train subjects
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt`: records of the train subjects
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt`: names of the feature labels
+ `UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt`: names of the activity labels
These files are stored in dataframes by `run_analysis.R`.

#### Extracting the variables describing mean and standard deviation
Of all 561 variables provided in the records only those 79 variables are kept which describe either means or standard deviations. Note that we also keep the variables of the type `meanFreq`. The other variables are removed from the dataframes.

#### Putting the data together and providing descriptive names for the variables and the activity labels
+ The data of the test subjects and the train subjects are joined. 
+ The variable containing the subject lables is renamed to `subject`.
+ The variable containing the activity labels is renamed to `activity`.
+ The variables containing the records are renamed to the names provided in the `features.txt`.
+ These data are joined to one dataframe `data`.
+ The variable containig the subject lables is made into a factor with descriptive labels provided by `activity_lables.txt`.
+ The variable containing the subject lables is made into a factor.

#### Averaging the data in view of test subjects and activities
Using `data` a second dataframe `data2` is constructed which contains the average of each of the 79 variables for each activity and each subject.

### 3.The variables in the dataframes

Both dataframes `data` and `data2` contain the same variables.
Whereas `data` contains 10299 single records, `data2` contains the average of each of the 79 numerical variables for each activity and each subject.

+ **subject**  
    Factor with 30 levels representing the thirty test volunteers  
    1-30 

+ **activity** 
    Factor with 6 levels representing the activities performed by the subjects  
    WALKING  
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
    SITTING  
    STANDING  
    LAYING  

The remaining 79 variables contain numerical test data ('mean/std' indicates that there exists one variable for the mean and a different variable for the standard deviation of this quantity; 'XYZ' vindicates that there exists three separate variables for the X, Y, and Z-direction describing the quantity). All variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
